What should a Junior QA Engineer Resume contain?

! Important: write your Resume in English

1. First Name, Last Name (real ones)
2. Contact Info (add several ways to contact you)
3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).
4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
5. Experience (for a Junior QA it means all kinds of experience: courses, interesting tasks - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)

**NOTE!** You are recommended to use real data. However fake data will do too.
